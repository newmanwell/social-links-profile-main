This challenge from front end mentor was to create a simple page with links to your personal social media and coding website profiles.
* The only part that was completed for you was the text of the HTML (no elements).
* All CSS was up to me as well with just a little guidance on color and font family.
* These challenges are a nice way to learn how to ensure your page looks good on different devices (laptop, tablet, cell)
